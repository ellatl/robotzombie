*Open* with a flyover of avenues and streets, all deserted. Closeup on an overturned __Nuts4Nuts__ stand, with the
umbrella rolling slowly through the street and coming to a stop. Big zoomout of the city, where we see the zombie
army moving south from the north. Ominous noises. Pan to 89th street, covered in fog. As it zooms in on Dalton, we
hear loud bangs and yells -- the normal sounds of robotics. Cut to 5th floor. There is yelling, chaos, people running
around. MSW and Charlie are trying to get the attention of the students as they are fighting.

MSW: "Guys! You're not getting anything done so I'm giving you an assessment because apparently your impending zombie **doom** is not sufficient to make you work together!"

Devin: "Oh no! Will it affect our grades?"

Liam: "Haha sucks for all of you that aren't into college and still have to think about grades."

MSW: "Your new assessment is seeing how lethal to zombies you can make your robot. This will be measured by speed, number of weapons included, and ultimately how many zombies you destroy."
